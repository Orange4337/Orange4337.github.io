                                It's nice to see a company focussed on design come down from a level that feels unreachable.
                                I enjoyed hearing they too had had a past of inconsistency and had worked to fix it.

                                This was a really nice guide for how to design spacing on a page. 
                                It was nice to see a definition of adaptive layout, as I have been wondering whether that was common design practice. 
                                I've really only observed responsive and strict layouts so hearing that it is an option is nice.

                                I have honestly not thought much about the content of this article before.
                                But I appreciate the clarification on Common vocabulary and casing.
                                The other areas mentioned are definitely more useful for industry, but I will keep this article in mind for future reference.

                                The way the Steve krug takes time to anologize poohysical navigation and virtual navigation is very helpful.
                                Although we may not think about how to get places all the time, we need to remember this while designing our websites.
                                He has lots of good tips about how obvious things should be and how important the mindset of searching for something is.
                                You are here is an especially helpful section, because I often feel like excluding this part in my design.
                                In the future I will make sure to add this back into my designs.

                                It's nice to have a written reference for the feelings colors can invoke. I also enjoyed how they spoke of personal color. I tend to associate memebers of my family with their favorite color. For some, like my grandmother's red, it made a lot of sense.
                                Others seemed harder to pin down. But maybe color preference can be like a horoscope. If you like blue you are more calm, but I think it can be hard to have the same perspective on color and have it mean the same to everyone.

                                Becuase I have Previously taken Color and Composition. Much of this chapter was simply a good review on the verbiage we use when describing color.
                                I did enjoy the opening where they described the experience of color and from the scientific light reflection to the synesthetic musings of Wassily Kadinsky.
                                Sometimes I forget how different everyone's experience of even the presence of color can be different.
                                But I truly enjoyed the passage on discord and dissonance. It's not often that books encourage you to break rules, or consider the chance to break rules. The aesthetic rules of minimalism can be quite restrictive.
                                I want to take time to redesign my own spaces and find ways to break rules in how I arrange things. It truly plays into the conscious break of rules that we have discussed in our courses.
