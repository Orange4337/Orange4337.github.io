                        A group of my peers got the opportunity to research and present certain groups of people's
                        unique design requirements.
                        I presented on Rural communities, but others advocated for Gen-Z, color blindness etc.
                        Afterward we had to advocate for each group's needs and argue down to a list of about 12
                        features that would be necessary in a vote by mail website.
                        For rural communities I focused on meeting their needs for reliability and clarity.
                        I originally recommended low wi-fi accessibility as well as a comprehensive set of instructions
                        for the entire interface.
                        Luckily, many other teams had similar needs so by grouping up with many other groups Those made
                        it into the final set of features.
                        Some of my goals needed to be reworded to fit in some of my allies needs.
                        My low wi-fi requirement was combined with quick loading times for Gen-Z.
                        in addition to this the comprehensive set of instructions was combined and cosigned with several
                        other teams to result in the inclusion of a setp-by-step guided process with visual aids for
                        multi step tasks.
                        I also was convinced to cosign having a flesch Kincaid reading ease score greater than or equal
                        to ninety percent.
                        Honestly, this activity was a little chaotic, but it was really interesting to hear what each
                        group's needs are and find common ground between unsuspected allies.
                        I think that It's a good reminder that disabilities are a spectrum and at any point in your life
                        you could need more or less help.
                        Today's people will be different than tomorrow's and we need to be prepared for their needs as
                        time goes by.

                        The example of the Lego police officer on the motorcycle was very helpful.
                        It was easy to understand the four types of constraints(physical, cultural, semantic and
                        logical).
                        I am reminded of many times where I have attempted to disassemble items to clean them and put
                        them back together relying on the previous construction and what I think fits.
                        Having to disassemble a vacuum to clean the filter or clear the wheels of my hair has always
                        been made easier by the design of the vacuum.
                        The ideas he as for mapping out light switches were interesting to me.
                        They may be useful for a physical representation of lights, but they may be easier to implement
                        in a digital format.
                        Physical representation is good, but I wonder about the pedestal and the jutting out panel being
                        obstacles or something I might run into.
                        I liked the idea of an indent, that helps keep switches of the way physically and can still
                        fascilitate the access I think he intended.
                        The passage on the faucet felt very familiar to me.
                        I have struggled with my aunt's faucet everytime I visit.
                        There is a handle to control water temperature, but the faucet itself is touch opperated.
                        When you want to turn on the flow of water you need to tap the spout.
                        As a software engineer I am more familiar with constraints forcing behavior.
                        I still fall for it when people forget to add them in though.
                        I ordered the smallest pair of pants from a compnay because they do not require users to pick
                        the size they want before adding it to their cart they just have a default setting for the
                        smallest size.
                        It would have been nice to at least be prompted before adding it to the cart.
                        As far as his experience with crossing roads being more difficult with the rise of silent cars,
                        I agree.
                        I often am distracted when walking around town and rely on my hearing to know if a bike or car
                        is coming.

                    <p>
                        I have often thought about inclusive design when it comes to colors.
                        I appreciate his recommendatio of CSS as a coder I have pretty much always used it, but now I
                        have another reason to continue using it.
                        I appreciate a lot of the tips for creating pages that are resizeable and having skip to content
                        buittons.
                        I also will be implementing more keyboard functions from now on.
                        Krug often writes things in a humorous manner. So the final chapter on how to speak with your
                        boss about being asked to do bad design is quite fun.
                        I probably will not rely on his emails, but it was a nice gesture.

                        I like that Krug starts by making a case for User testing in chapter 8.
                        I have had many arguments about what form of Interface would be best, without having the chance
                        to test.
                        Testing should be a priority where there are questions, and arguing about details is a waste of
                        time when users are available.
                        It's good to see the theme of fail fast and fail early in chapter 9.
                        I also appreciater the idea of doing it frequently and early important.
                        To that end he has some advice for interviewing that is helpful. Like just being more efficient
                        by using anyone a truly random sample.

                        i love how clean all of these portfolios look.
                        This really shows how many trends there are in design.
                        There are lots of similar colot choices and similar layouts that pop up throughout the
                        Portfolios.
                        The most interesting ones to me were Adrian Weber, Melysia C, Alyssa Ignacio, and Dae Hyun Baek.
                        I feel they really broke some of the monotony of these pages and had a fun way of breaking rules
                        that made their designs interesting.

                        I enjoy how much Figma really tries to give uses as much information and help as possible to
                        help them use their tools.
                        The version history they have could be really useful to just have the changes laid out
                        chronologically.
                        I tend to lose sight of where I started in the process and this could be good for fixing that
                        habit.
                        Because I have used Figma and Adobe XD in the past I have a good foundations for what can be
                        done in prototyping.
                        I think my next steps after watching this will be learning the keyboard shortcuts for Figma.
                        Hopefully this will make using this tool more efficient.

                        Starting with encouragement to approach each issue with beginner's eyes is good advice.
                        Positivity through your work can be a way of keeping yourself from urning out and finding
                        enjoyment in the process.
                        Healthy curiosity is important n how we approach a new project.
                        Working with constraints can be helpful some of my favorite classes have been ones where the
                        only requirements were restrictions.
                        In color and composition we made pieces using limited color palettes.
                        I think a cyclical reminder of core values and message is as important as Reynolds says.
                        If we continue to return to the point we can also help our users get the point.

                        Alot of the time I feel retisent to give feedback to my peers.
                        Hearing the benefits listed out in favor of feedback is encouraging.
                        I will work to give as helpful feedback as possible in the future.
                        To that end, getting tips for how to talk about work with a designer is also helpful.
                        I'm so glad the compliment sandwich is being thrown out.
                        In previous projects I have experienced problems with giving normal feedback to my peers and
                        they would request a complient sandwich.
                        Inevitably resulting in the remainder of their task being thrown to rest of the team while they
                        expected gratitut]de for delivering the wrong results.
                        It was also reassuring to hear that not being able to take that feedback was not the fault of my
                        delivery, but simply an unused skill of taking criticism.
                        I will definitely be using the tools of fostering feedback with myself.

                        I enjoyed having a reminder that I should not try to put everything in the home page.
                        I'm a little worried about advertising on websites, but maybe that's just me.
                        I was not even taking them into account in web design, because they're the worst.
                        Most of what I look at online are companies not hurting for money enough to add advertisements
                        to their pages.
                        Those companies usually only need to advertise their own products so they might use an entire
                        page for promotion.
                        I hope I never need to consider advertising other things on a website I design.

                        As I'm working through muy projects it's nice to see someone else solving similar problems at
                        the same time as me. I think some of the thought processes and tool explanations are super
                        helpful.
                        I'll definitely be rewatcing this in the coming weeks. I like how approacvhable he makes working
                        on this
                        feel and I'm excited to get in the weeds.

                        It's nice to see a company focussed on design come down from a level that feels unreachable.
                        I enjoyed hearing they too had had a past of inconsistency and had worked to fix it.

                        This was a really nice guide for how to design spacing on a page.
                        It was nice to see a definition of adaptive layout, as I have been wondering whether that was
                        common design practice.
                        I've really only observed responsive and strict layouts so hearing that it is an option is nice.

                    <h2>Google Calculator - Color Analysis</h2>
                    <p>
                        The origianl Colors of Google's calculator are greys, blue, black and white.
                        Blue is often seen as trustworthy this shade is bright and really draws the eye.
                        I could tell they wanted to emphasize their numbers and that equal sign more the other buttons.
                        <br /><br />
                        I wanted to start by adding more emphasis to the other sign buttons and switching to something
                        more enegized so I changed to a bright orange.
                        This lost some of that important emphasis on the = in the calculator. It also might not have
                        been the best shade it was a little agressive.
                        <br /><br />
                        Next I had to try a more muted color so I chose a sage and replaced the blue with that.
                        I thought it could be more natural than the Blue, but I understand why google needs to follow
                        their own guides for coloring.
                        Also in addition to the stark white and black it was not a great match.
                        I considered making it a tan or brown arrangement, but found that that might be too far from the
                        ordinary and ind of jarring.
                        <br /><br />
                        Then I tested a brighter green, but found that it would match better with a black background.
                        I feel this green has a similar effect to the original blue and keeps the numbers interesting.
                        Making the numbers a lighter green added more emphasis without competing with the = button.
                        <br /><br />
                        Finally I wanted to see if the dark theme would work with that original blue used by google.
                        I ended up not loving just a tinted blue it was too distracting unlike the light green.
                        A grey blue worked, but I'm not as happy with it as just the dark theme Google already has, I
                        feel that may be why they had chosen such a minimal use of color.
                        Dark theme really limits what colors are still usable after switching backgrounds.
                        <br /><br />
                        I think my personal favorite color is the dark themed green. Green is my favorite color and I
                        also prefer dark mode for most things.
                        However I believe that Google's original is more robust and works better both light and dark
                        themes.

                        The way the Steve krug takes time to anologize poohysical navigation and virtual navigation is
                        very helpful.
                        Although we may not think about how to get places all the time, we need to remember this while
                        designing our websites.
                        He has lots of good tips about how obvious things should be and how important the mindset of
                        searching for something is.
                        You are here is an especially helpful section, because I often feel like excluding this part in
                        my design.
                        In the future I will make sure to add this back into my designs.

                        It's nice to have a written reference for the feelings colors can invoke. I also enjoyed how
                        they spoke of personal color. I tend to associate memebers of my family with their favorite
                        color. For some, like my grandmother's red, it made a lot of sense.
                        Others seemed harder to pin down. But maybe color preference can be like a horoscope. If you
                        like blue you are more calm, but I think it can be hard to have the same perspective on color
                        and have it mean the same to everyone.

                        Becuase I have Previously taken Color and Composition. Much of this chapter was simply a good
                        review on the verbiage we use when describing color.
                        I did enjoy the opening where they described the experience of color and from the scientific
                        light reflection to the synesthetic musings of Wassily Kadinsky.
                        Sometimes I forget how different everyone's experience of even the presence of color can be
                        different.
                        But I truly enjoyed the passage on discord and dissonance. It's not often that books encourage
                        you to break rules, or consider the chance to break rules. The aesthetic rules of minimalism can
                        be quite restrictive.
                        I want to take time to redesign my own spaces and find ways to break rules in how I arrange
                        things. It truly plays into the conscious break of rules that we have discussed in our courses.
