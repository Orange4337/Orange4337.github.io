                                Alot of the time I feel retisent to give feedback to my peers.
                                Hearing the benefits listed out in favor of feedback is encouraging.
                                I will work to give as helpful feedback as possible in the future.
                                To that end, getting  tips for how to talk about work with a designer is also helpful.
                                I'm so glad the compliment sandwich is being thrown out.
                                In previous projects I have experienced problems with giving normal feedback to my peers and they would request a complient sandwich.
                                Inevitably resulting in the remainder of their task being thrown to rest of the team while they expected gratitut]de for delivering the wrong results.
                                It was also reassuring to hear that not being able to take that feedback was not the fault of my delivery, but simply an unused skill of taking criticism.
                                I will definitely be using the tools of fostering feedback with myself.

                                I enjoyed having a reminder that I should not try to put everything in the home page. 
                                I'm a little worried about advertising on websites, but maybe that's just me. 
                                I was not even taking them into account in web design, because they're the worst. 
                                Most of what I look at online are companies not hurting for money enough to add advertisements to their pages.
                                Those companies usually only need to advertise their own products so they might use an entire page for promotion.
                                I hope I never need to consider advertising other things on a website I design.

                                the same time as me. I think some of the thought processes and tool explanations are super helpful. 
                                I'll definitely be rewatcing this in the coming weeks. I like how approacvhable he makes working on this

                                It's nice to see a company focussed on design come down from a level that feels unreachable.
                                I enjoyed hearing they too had had a past of inconsistency and had worked to fix it.

                                This was a really nice guide for how to design spacing on a page. 
                                It was nice to see a definition of adaptive layout, as I have been wondering whether that was common design practice. 
                                I've really only observed responsive and strict layouts so hearing that it is an option is nice.

                                I have honestly not thought much about the content of this article before.
                                But I appreciate the clarification on Common vocabulary and casing.
                                The other areas mentioned are definitely more useful for industry, but I will keep this article in mind for future reference.

                                The way the Steve krug takes time to anologize poohysical navigation and virtual navigation is very helpful.
                                Although we may not think about how to get places all the time, we need to remember this while designing our websites.
                                He has lots of good tips about how obvious things should be and how important the mindset of searching for something is.
                                You are here is an especially helpful section, because I often feel like excluding this part in my design.
                                In the future I will make sure to add this back into my designs.

                                It's nice to have a written reference for the feelings colors can invoke. I also enjoyed how they spoke of personal color. I tend to associate memebers of my family with their favorite color. For some, like my grandmother's red, it made a lot of sense.
                                Others seemed harder to pin down. But maybe color preference can be like a horoscope. If you like blue you are more calm, but I think it can be hard to have the same perspective on color and have it mean the same to everyone.

                                Becuase I have Previously taken Color and Composition. Much of this chapter was simply a good review on the verbiage we use when describing color.
                                I did enjoy the opening where they described the experience of color and from the scientific light reflection to the synesthetic musings of Wassily Kadinsky.
                                Sometimes I forget how different everyone's experience of even the presence of color can be different.
                                But I truly enjoyed the passage on discord and dissonance. It's not often that books encourage you to break rules, or consider the chance to break rules. The aesthetic rules of minimalism can be quite restrictive.
                                I want to take time to redesign my own spaces and find ways to break rules in how I arrange things. It truly plays into the conscious break of rules that we have discussed in our courses.
