                    <!--Beginning:Ideation – Role, Why, What, Target Device, Target Audience, Improvement goal-->
                    As a member of the Sheldon Student Advisory Board, I frequently visit <a
                        href="https://sheldonartmuseum.org/">Sheldon’s website</a>
                    to look up art, artists, and exhibitions. I was bothered by a couple of issues on their
                    website. First, there was a lot of inefficiently organized information. Second, they must
                    follow the design System of the University of Nebraska Lincoln, which limits their palette
                    and ability to brand themselves separately. I attempted to leverage my experience and
                    connections to design a website that would be more individual and more well-organized.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to the density of information on the current Sheldon website, it was best to design for desktop
                    to preserve the information necessary for users. I also wanted to add a mapping feature to the
                    current exhibitions in the Sheldon. I focussed on the experience of students as they are the current
                    focus of the museum. I worked to improve efficiency for students, aesthetics, and attempted to add
                    on a map feature.

                    I began the process by sketching out the general frames I thought would be necessary in the website.
                    I tried to start with reorganizing the information in the website. Then I applied that to a layout
                    that used the rule of thirds to organize frames of information. I also considered gestalt principles
                    of hierarchy to make sure related information would be grouped together visually.

                    <!--Design System – highlight some choices (colors, fonts etc.)-->
                    I started my design system by watching <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK-pHkc5EL4&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx6ZQswH9nVKVMCsK83OzhoV">
                        Build it in Figma: Create a Design System</a>
                    I then thought about what colors made sense for the Sheldon. I thought about intelligence and
                    trustworthiness are aspects of the color blue. I thought about purple being a color associated with
                    wealth and I thought that pushing an indigo color would fit. I also incorporated a mint green to be
                    something in contrast with the indigo. I then tested out shading the indigo to get a nice type color
                    and lightening that type color to get a background.

                    <!-- Mock Up -->
                    After I had a design system and sketches I worked on creating a mockup in Figma I decided to remove
                    a couple of pages and made it as close to what I saw as the final product as possible.

                    I converted my mockup into a prototype by adding page links. I then got peer feedback
                    from a classmate and had them go through my user test and give whatever input they could. Some of
                    the feedback was on how I presented my user test, some were bugs in my prototype. After fixing what
                    I could I felt prepared for user tests.

                    <!---User Tests-->
                    I did 3 user tests: one with a software engineering student, one with a fashion merchandising
                    student, and the last with an adult outside of UNL. I asked them to complete 2 tasks: 'find a good
                    day to visit the Sheldon where you could bring children and have an activity for them to do', and
                    'find a painting you are interested in and find its physical location in the museum.'
                    I found that I needed to work more on making the spacing more equal, I needed to change some
                    coloring, and I needed to work more on the mapping section of the website.

                    As I have time, I am continuing to improve the final prototype, but I think that my growth can
                    easily be shown in this project. It's been really interesting to learn hands on some of the
                    processes that go into designing a web page. I also feel like I have learned a lot about Figma which
                    I will definitely be using in the future.
